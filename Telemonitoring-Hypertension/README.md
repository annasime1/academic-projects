# Telemedicine Monitoring System for Hypertensive Patients

## Overview
This project focuses on the **design and implementation of a telemedicine platform** to monitor patients with **hypertension**.  
The goal is to support physicians and healthcare providers in managing patients more effectively, while empowering patients through **self-monitoring, lifestyle awareness, and community support**.  

The system integrates **wearable devices, manual data entry, medical reports, and questionnaires** to provide a holistic view of the patient’s health status.  
It also includes a **forum section** for sharing experiences and lifestyle advice, enhancing patient engagement and awareness.

## Features
- **Patient profile management** (activation, updates, and deactivation).  
- **Data collection**: blood pressure, heart rate, weight, circadian rhythms, sleep, steps, physical activity, glycemia (for diabetic patients).  
- **Medical reports upload**: blood analysis, urinalysis, ECG, fundus oculi, endocrine analysis.  
- **Questionnaires**: MMAS-8, EuroQol-5D, PHQ-9, PSQI, stress and lifestyle-related forms.  
- **Risk assessment**: machine learning–based classification algorithm for cardiovascular risk prediction.  
- **Communication**: physician–patient interactions, visit scheduling, and forum for lifestyle suggestions and community Q&A.  
- **Multi-user system**: patients, physicians, technical administrators, and other healthcare providers (nurses, physiotherapists, nutritionists).

## Methodology
- **Context analysis**: focus on hypertension prevalence, comorbidities, and current digital health challenges.  
- **Wearable device integration**: evaluation of available certified devices (e.g., Huawei Watch D).  
- **System modeling**:  
  - Textual descriptions of user interactions.  
  - Use case, activity, and class diagrams.  
  - Risk assessment and notification flow.  
- **Design principles**: usability, patient empowerment, modularity for adding new parameters/questionnaires.

## Expected Benefits
- Improved **therapy adherence** and patient engagement.  
- **Holistic monitoring** beyond blood pressure (including lifestyle and comorbidities).  
- Better **risk stratification** through AI-driven analysis.  
- Reduced burden on healthcare systems via **self-management** and remote monitoring.
