# Cardio-Respiratory Effects of Laughter and Laughter Therapy

## Overview
This project investigates the **acute cardio-respiratory effects of laughter** and the **long-term impact of laughter therapy** (16 sessions) on healthy young adults.  
The study combines **respiratory monitoring (OEP)** and **cardiac monitoring (EqO2+ Life Monitor)** to measure changes in ventilation, lung volumes, heart rate, and heart rate variability.

## Dataset & Protocol
- **Subjects**: 10 healthy participants (20–22 years).  
- **Protocol**:  
  - **Baseline (QB)** → **Laughter (LT)** → **Recovery (REC)**.  
  - Measurements repeated **pre-therapy** and **post-therapy**.  
- **Devices**:  
  - **OEP** (Optoelectronic Plethysmography): thoraco-abdominal volumes, ventilation.  
  - **EqO2+ Life Monitor**: heart rate and variability.  

---

## Methods
- Analysis of **ventilatory patterns**: tidal volume, respiratory rate, functional residual capacity.  
- Cardiovascular measures: heart rate, heart rate variability (SD1, SD2).  
- Comparison between **acute effects (QB vs LT vs REC)** and **chronic effects (pre- vs post-therapy)**.  
- Statistical significance assessed (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001).

## Results
### Acute effects (during laughter):
- ↑ Pulmonary ventilation (tidal volume + frequency).  
- ↓ End-expiratory lung volumes.  
- ↑ Heart rate and sympathetic activity.  

### Long-term effects (after laughter therapy):
- ↑ Heart rate variability (parasympathetic modulation).  
- ↓ Systolic and diastolic blood pressure.  
- Improved **autonomic regulation** and **training effect** (reduced effort for same exercise).

## Discussion
- **Laughter = submaximal exercise** with acute cardiorespiratory activation.  
- **Laughter therapy** improves cardiovascular regulation and may act as a **protective factor** for long-term health.  
- Limited sample size → further studies on larger and pathological populations are needed.
