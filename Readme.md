# Academic Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio repository, collecting the most relevant academic projects developed during my studies in **Biomedical Engineering**.  
Each folder contains a standalone project with its own description, methodology, results, and additional resources.

## Projects Included

| Project | Short Description |
|---------|--------------------|
| **Blood Cell Classification** | Classification of blood cells into 8 categories using CNN, VGG16, and EfficientNet. Best performance: EfficientNetV2-M with Lion optimizer (~85% accuracy). |
| **Lung Nodule Classification** | CT-based classification of lung nodules (benign vs malignant) using custom CNNs and EfficientNetB2. Includes explainability (Grad-CAM, LIME). Best F1-score ~81%. |
| **Remote PPG (rPPG) Analysis** | Comparative study of chrominance-based and blind source separation (ICA/PCA) methods for heart rate estimation from video. XsminαYs and PCA achieved the most robust results (>96% agreement within ±5 BPM). |
| **Attention Classification in ASD** | Deep learning model (MLP) for classifying attention in children with ASD from gaze-tracking data during robot-assisted therapy. Best F1-score ~47%. |
| **Bragg Peak Simulation** | Geant4 Monte Carlo simulation of proton therapy (CATANA setup for ocular tumors). Analysis of Bragg Peak depth, energy spread, and biological dose effects. |
| **Cardio-Respiratory Effects of Laughter** | Experimental study on acute cardio-respiratory responses to laughter and long-term effects of laughter therapy, using OEP and EqO2+ Life Monitor. |
| **Telemedicine System for Hypertension** | Design of a telemedicine platform for hypertensive patients: clinical data acquisition, questionnaires, reports, risk scoring, physician–patient communication, and lifestyle forum. |
